# Quick Tarot App

## What is this app?
This is the backend half of Quick Tarot :) 
This is where the server and database is.

## Running this application
### Backend
cd into the backend folder
uvicorn main:app --reload

### Activating /.venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

## To do log for me :)
### TODO: Change to using db
For now I'm using an in script way to keep track of IP instances so my OpenAI does not get spammed.
I want to change from an in script to a database in the future.
